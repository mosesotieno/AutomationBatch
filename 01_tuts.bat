:: BODY

:: Introduction 

:: Batch Scripts are stored in simple text files containing lines with commands that get executed in sequence, :: one after the other. Scripting is a way by which one can alleviate this necessity by automating these 
:: command sequences in order to make oneâ€™s life at the shell easier and more productive. 


:: Remember that we can comment out using :: and Rem. @echo off helps hiding the comments from being printed 
:: in the console. This script goes through the very introduction to commands in batch
